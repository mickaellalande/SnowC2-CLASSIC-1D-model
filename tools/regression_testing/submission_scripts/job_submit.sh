# Script to launch CLASSIC model runs on either the supercomputers or the front-end clusters.

# Usage: Modify the "User specified parameter" section as necessary and then just execute this script
#        on the platform chosen to do the run.

# The final output netCDF files will be stored in the directory "netcdf_files" under the user specified
# output directory.

# If a configure.R file exists in the user specified output directory, a job to run AMBER will be
# automatically launched on one of the ppps at the end of the model run.

# Background:

# CLASSIC currently runs well in parallel on a single node, but not across multiple nodes.

# The work-around is to run the model on a subset of the domain on each node. The number of nodes
# required is automatically computed based on the number of land grid cells in the domain, the
# estimated time required to run the simulation and the maximum wallclock allowed per node.

# At the end of the run, the files from each node will be stored in separate directories of the form
# "netcdf_files_XX", below the user specified output directory. Each directory will correspond to a subset
# of the full domain where XX is numbered sequentially from 01, 02, etc. These are stitched together
# to produce the full domain and will be stored in the "netcdf_files" directory.

# Modifications:
#
# Ed Chan, Aug 2020:
#   - Added consistency check for grid type and subgrid limits.
# Ed Chan, Jul 2020: 
#   - For regular grids, set default max/min lat/lon based on the GC variable in the initialization file.
# Ed Chan, Dec 2019: Migrate to new supercomputers and front-ends.
#   - Removed the option to specify the size of /tmp on the front-ends as the default size of almost 90 GB
#     should be more than sufficient.
#   - System versions of cdo/nco are sufficiently recent on the front-ends, so specifying the paths to 
#     these utilities are only needed when running on the supercomputers.
#   - The hostfile must now be specified for "rumpirun" on the front-ends.
#   - Specify the same number of available CPUs (i.e. 40) for both supercomputers and front-ends.
#   - Adjust PBS directives for the new platforms, including changing the read permission of the job output file.
#   - Load newer versions of libraries/modules into the model run environment.
#   - Automatically launch a job on the ppp to run AMBER if a configure.R script exists in the output directory.
# Ed Chan, May 2019.
#   - Added support for the supercomputers.
#   - Added check of all input files specified in the job options file.
#   - Revised execution method so that if one node runs out of time, the others
#     will still copy completed files to the output directory.
# Ed Chan, Jan 2019.
#   - Split latitude bands so that boundaries are half-way between latitudes.
# Ed Chan, Jan 2019.
#   - Replaced mpirun with rumpirun for OpenMPI on front-ends since it has better support.
#   - Added option to allow user to additionally request the max available wallclock time per node.
# Ed Chan, Dec 2018.
#   - Allow user to review job parameters and input a different number of nodes.
#   - Added stitching of netCDF output files at the end of the job (if necessary).
#   - Made required modifications to the mpirun command line after recent system changes.
#   - Cleaned up command line generation for regular grids.

# Initial implementation: Ed Chan, Oct 2018 (based on Vivek's script for supercomputers)

# A metric "phi" is used below as an estimate of the model's performance on a given platform for a typical model configuration.
# *** If jobs time out, it may need to be adjusted (downwards), especially if options such as saving daily output are turned on.
#
# The metric is defined as the number of grid cells that can be run over the length of the simulation
# (in years) per hour (i.e. gridcells*years/hour) and can be estimated by timing a (short) model run.
# It is used to estimate the number of nodes required to run the entire simulation under the constraint
# of the max wallclock time permitted on each node.
#
# For the Canada domain, 18300 grid cells can run for 2 years in ~0.5 hours.
# If A = 18300, B = 2, and C = 0.5, then A*B/C = 73200 gridcell-years/hour.
# Choose a somewhat lower number to be safe.
