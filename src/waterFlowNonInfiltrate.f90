  !
  !>
  !! In loops 150 and 200, the theoretical amounts of water FDT
  !! flowing across the soil layer boundaries are calculated. FDT is
  !! evaluated as the product of the flow rate F(z) at the given depth
  !! z, and the period of time (DT) over which the flow is occurring.
  !! At z=0, the water flux is simply equal to the soil surface
  !! evaporation rate. Within the soil, the flow rate F at a given
  !! depth z is obtained using equation 21 from Verseghy (1991):
  !!
  !! \f$F(z) = K(z) [-b \Psi(z)/\theta_l(z) \times d\theta_l / dz + 1]\f$
  !!
  !! where K(z) is the hydraulic conductivity and psi(z) is the soil
  !! moisture suction at depth z, and b is an empirical parameter
  !! developed by Clapp and Hornberger (1978) \cite Clapp1978-898. K(z) and \f$\Psi(z)\f$ are
  !! calculated following Clapp and Hornberger as
  !!
  !! \f$K(z) = K_{sat} (\theta_l/\theta_p)^{(2b + 3)}\f$
  !!
  !! \f$\Psi(z) = \Psi_{sat} (\theta_l/\theta_p)^{(-b)}\f$
  !!
  !! where \f$K_{sat}\f$ and \f$\Psi_{sat}\f$ are the values of \f$K\f$ and \f$\Psi\f$ respectively
  !! at saturation.
  !!
  !! At the bottom of the permeable soil depth, in layer IGDR, if the
  !! liquid water content of the soil is greater than the field
  !! capacity, the vertical flow out of the bottom of the soil profile
  !! is calculated using a relation derived from Soulis et al. (2010):
  !!
  !! \f$F(z_b) = K_{sat} \times min{1, (\theta_l /\theta_p)/[1 – 1/(2b + 3)]^{(2b + 3)}}\f$
  !!
  !! This flow rate is multiplied by a drainage parameter XDRAIN,
  !! which is set to 0 if the soil is underlain by an impermeable
  !! layer (as in a bog), and to 1 otherwise.

  !! Between soil layers, values of \f$K(z)\f$ and \f$\Psi(z)\f$ must be
  !! determined. This requires the estimation of soil properties at
  !! the layer interfaces. For \f$\theta_l\f$, \f$\theta_p\f$ and \f$d(\theta_l)/dz\f$, slightly
  !! different approaches are followed if the permeable soil layer
  !! thickness DELZW increases with depth (the normal case), or if it
  !! decreases between one soil layer and the next (indicating the
  !! presence of an impermeable barrier at some depth in the second
  !! layer). In the first case, the pore volume THPBND, liquid water
  !! content THLBND, and liquid water gradient DTHLDZ are simply
  !! calculated as arithmetic averages of the values above and below
  !! the interface. This has the effect of weighting the interface
  !! values towards the upper layer values, roughly emulating a
  !! surfaceward exponential decay curve of liquid water content. In
  !! the second case, in order to avoid a spurious weighting towards
  !! the lower layer, the gradients of liquid water content and pore
  !! volume between the upper and lower layers are calculated as
  !! linear relations, and then solved for the values at the
  !! interface.
  !!
  !! The Clapp and Hornberger b parameter at the interface is
  !! calculated as a simple average of the values in the upper and
  !! lower soil layers. The saturated hydraulic conductivity \f$K_{sat, bnd}\f$ is
  !! calculated as a harmonic mean, and the saturated soil moisture
  !! suction \f$\Psi_{sat, bnd}\f$ as a geometric mean, of the top and bottom
  !! layer values:
  !!
  !! \f$
  !! K_{sat, bnd} = K_{sat, t} K_{sat, b}
  !! ( \Delta z_{g, w, , t} + \Delta z_{g, w, , b} ) / ( K_{sat, t} \Delta z_{g, w, b} + K_{sat, b} \Delta z_{g, w, t} )
  !! \f$
  !!
  !! \f$
  !! \Psi_{sat, bnd} = \Psi_{sat, t}^{\Delta zg, w, t/(\Delta zg, w, t + \Delta zg, w, b)}
  !! \Psi_{sat, b}^{\Delta zg, w, b/(\Delta zg, w, t + \Delta zg, w, b)}
  !! \f$
  !!
  !! Finally, K(z), \f$\Psi(z)\f$ and F(z) at the interface are calculated
  !! from the equations given above. At the end of the loop, if
  !! set to zero behind the soil layer LZF containing the wetting
  !! front, and the flow rate at the bottom of LZF is constrained to
  !! be \f$\geq\f$ 0.

  !! In the next several loops, checks are carried out to ascertain

  !! interfaces can be supported by the water contents in the layers.
  !! At the beginning of loop 250, the soil surface evaporation rate
  !! is addressed. A trial liquid water content THTEST is calculated
  !! for the first soil layer, reflecting the removal of the
  !! evaporated water. If THTEST is less than the minimum soil water
  !! content, F(0) is set to zero and \f$\theta_l\f$ is set to \f$\theta_{l, min}\f$. The
  !! excess surface flux that was not met by the removed liquid water
  !! is converted to a frozen water content, and an attempt is made to
  !! remove it from the frozen water in the layer. (The energy
  !! involved in converting the required frozen water mass to liquid
  !! water is obtained by decreasing the water temperature of the
  !! layer.) The frozen water content of the layer is adjusted to
  !! reflect the removal of the required amount. If the demand exceeds
  !! the supply of frozen water available, the frozen water content is
  !! set to zero, the diagnostic evaporative flux QFG at the soil
  !! surface is adjusted, and the remaining water flux not able to be
  !! met by the first soil layer is assigned to the variable WLOST.
  !!
  !! In the remainder of the 250 loop, checks are carried out for soil
  !! layers with liquid water contents already effectively equal to
  !! \f$\theta_{l, min}\f$. If the flux at the top of the layer is upward and that at
  !! the bottom of the layer is downward, both are set to zero. If
  !! both are downward, only the flux at the bottom is set to zero; if
  !! both are upward, only the flux at the top is set to zero. If the
  !! soil layer is an organic one and the liquid water content is less
  !! than the layer retention capacity THLRET and the flux at the
  !! bottom of the layer is downward, it is set to zero.
