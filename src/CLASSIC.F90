!! Principle driver program to run CLASSIC in stand-alone mode using specified boundary
!! conditions and atmospheric forcing. Depending upon the compiler options chosen, this
!! program will either run in MPI mode for use on parallel computing environments or

  ! MAIN PROGRAM

  ! First initialize the MPI and PnetCDF session. Ignored if run in serial mode.
  call initializeParallelEnvironment

  ! Next load the job options file. This first parses the command line arguments.
  ! Then all model switches are read in from a namelist file. This sets up the
  ! run options and points to input files as needed.
  call readFromJobOptions

  ! Then load the run setup information based on the metadata in the
  ! initialization netcdf file. The bounds given as an argument to
  ! CLASSIC are used to find the start points (srtx and srty)
  ! in the netcdf file, placing the gridcell on the domain of the
  ! input/output netcdfs. In read_modelsetup we use the netcdf to set
  ! the nmos (number of tiles), ignd (number of soil layers), and ilg (number of latitude
  ! points times nmos, which defaults to nmos in offline mode) constants.
  ! It also opens the initial conditions file that is used below in
  ! read_initialstate as well as the restart file that is written to later.
  call read_modelsetup
  
  ! Prepare all of the global parameters in classicParams
  ! which are read from a namelist file.
  call prepareGlobalParams
  
  ! The output files are created based on the model switches in the
  ! joboptions file and the xml file that describes the metadata for
  ! each output file. The loadoutputDescriptor parses the xml file and
  ! creates a data structure to allow us to make all of the netcdf output
  ! files, one per variable per time period (daily, monthly, etc.).
  call loadoutputDescriptor
  
  ! Generate the output files based on options in the joboptions file
  ! and the parameters of the initilization netcdf file.
  call generateOutputFiles
  
  ! Run model over the land grid cells, in parallel or serial
  call processLandCells
  
  ! Close all of the output netcdf files and the restart file
  ! (these were written to so need to ensure buffer is flushed)
  call closeNCFiles
  call closeNCFiles(rsid)
  
#if PARALLEL
