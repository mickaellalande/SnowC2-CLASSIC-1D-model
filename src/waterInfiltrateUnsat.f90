  !! The infiltration rate \f$F_{inf}\f$ under conditions of a constant water
  !! supply can be expressed, e.g. in Mein and Larson (1973), as
  !!
  !! \f$F_{inf} = \f$K_{inf}\f$ [(\Psi_f + z_f)/ z_f ]\f$
  !!
  !! where \f$K_{inf}\f$ is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil behind the
  !! wetting front, \f$\Psi_f\f$ is the soil moisture suction across the
  !! wetting front, and \f$z_f\f$ is the depth of the wetting front. It can
  !! be seen that \f$F_{inf}\f$ decreases with increasing \f$z_f\f$ to an asymptotic
  !! value of \f$K_{inf}\f$. Thus, if the rainfall rate r is less than
  !! \f$K_{inf}\f$, the actual infiltration rate is limited by r, i.e.
  !! \f$F_{inf} = r\f$. Otherwise, \f$F_{inf}\f$ will be equal to R until the right-hand
  !! side of the above equation becomes less than r, after which point
  !! the above equation applies and ponding of excess water begins on
  !! the surface. The depth of the wetting front at this time \f$t_p\f$ can
  !! be calculated by setting \f$F_{inf}\f$ equal to r in the above equation
  !! and solving for \f$z_f\f$. This results in:
  !!
  !! \f$z_f = \Psi_f /[r/K_{inf} – 1]\f$
  !!
  !! The amount of water added to the soil up to the time of ponding
  !! is \f$t_p r\f$, or \f$z_f (\theta_{inf} – \theta_l)\f$, where \f$\theta_l\f$ and \f$\theta_{inf}\f$ are
  !! respectively the liquid water content of the soil before and
  !! after the wetting front has passed. Setting these two equal and
  !! solving for \f$t_p\f$ results in
  !!
  !! \f$t_p = z_f (\theta_{inf} – \theta_l)/r\f$

  !>
  !! In the 100 loop, a check is done for each successive soil layer
  !! to compare the infiltration rate in the layer with the rainfall
  !! rate. If \f$K_{inf} < R\f$, a test calculation is performed to determine
  !! where the depth of the wetting front would theoretically occur at
  !! the ponding time \f$t_p\f$. If the calculated value of \f$z_f\f$ is less than
  !! the depth of the top of the soil layer, \f$z_f\f$ is set to the depth of
  !! the top of the layer; if \f$z_f\f$ falls within the soil layer, that
  !! value of \f$z_f\f$ is accepted. In both cases, the index LZF is set to
  !! the index of the layer, and the flag IFIND, indicating that \f$z_f\f$,
  !! has been successfully located, is set to 1. If the infiltration
  !! rate in the soil layer is greater than the rainfall rate, \f$z_f\f$ is
  !! provisionally set to the bottom of the current layer, and LZF to
  !! the index of the next layer. IFIND remains zero. If the
  !! infiltration rate in the layer is vanishingly small, \f$z_f\f$ is set to
  !! the depth of the top of the current layer, LZF to the index of
  !! the overlying layer, and IFIND to 1.
